Chrome extension that injects coordinates of markers on ENTSOG's map into the popups and adds a hook for middle clicking to get coordinates of any location on the map.

**Important:** Right now the coordinates are RELATIVE to the map as presented (not the world map), so the coordinates are not transferable to a normal world map. This sort of makes the coordinates useless. I don't know of a way to convert the coordinates to world coordinates at the moment, unfortunately.
